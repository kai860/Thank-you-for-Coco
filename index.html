  <p class="p1"> Coco,</p>
    <p class="p2">Im very sorry that I didn't get this to you sooner. I am very greatful that you allowed me to come up for a week in the beginning of the summer as well as the two weeks that I was able to come and work for you. It was awesome seeing Cash and being able to swim with you and him, also thank you for always letting me go and rock climb at the gym near you even though you probably don't have as much fun as me when you are there.  :) </p>
  <p>Love you and hope you can forgive me,</p>
